For more information about Kinesis please visit the [official documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kinesis/).

The KCL Source can read from several shards and rebalance automatically when other Workers are started or stopped. It also handles record sequence checkpoints.

## Usage

### AWS KCL Worker Source & checkpointer

The KCL Worker Source needs to create and manage Worker instances in order to consume records from Kinesis Streams.

In order to use it, you need to provide a Worker builder and the Source settings:

```scala
val workerSourceSettings = KinesisWorkerSourceSettings(
    bufferSize = 1000,
    terminateStreamGracePeriod = 1 minute)
  val builder: IRecordProcessorFactory => Worker = { recordProcessorFactory =>
    new Worker.Builder()
      .recordProcessorFactory(recordProcessorFactory)
      .config(
        new KinesisClientLibConfiguration(
          "myApp",
          "myStreamName",
          DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.getInstance(),
          s"${
            import scala.sys.process._
            "hostname".!!.trim()
          }:${java.util.UUID.randomUUID()}"
        )
      )
      .build()
  }
```

The Source also needs an `ExecutionContext` to run the Worker's thread and to commit/checkpoint records. Then the Source can be created as usual:

```scala
implicit val _ =
  ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1000))
KinesisWorkerSource(builder, workerSourceSettings).to(Sink.ignore)
```

### Committing records

The KCL Worker Source publishes messages downstream that can be committed in order to mark progression of consumers by shard. This process can be done manually or using the provided checkpointer Flow/Sink.

In order to use the Flow/Sink you must provide additional checkpoint settings:

```scala
val checkpointSettings = KinesisWorkerCheckpointSettings(100, 30 seconds)

KinesisWorkerSource(builder, workerSourceSettings)
  .via(KinesisWorker.checkpointRecordsFlow(checkpointSettings))
  .to(Sink.ignore)

KinesisWorkerSource(builder, workerSourceSettings).to(
  KinesisWorker.checkpointRecordsSink(checkpointSettings))
```
